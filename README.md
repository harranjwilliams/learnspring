# learnspring
Create a project where I specifically use as many spring projects as possible.
Most of the information regard what I will be doing will be located in the Wiki of this project.

Project set up: 
1) Create a folder on your machine.  For this example, the folder's name is "LearnSpring".
2) In the command-line application (Terminal, CMD, Powersell, Git Bash) go into the LearnSpring folder.
3) Type "git init" to initialize a git repository
